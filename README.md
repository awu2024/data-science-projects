# Data Science Projects Portfolio
## Description
Welcome to my repository showcasing various data science projects! These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling using Python.

Throughout these projects, I utilize libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to explore, process, and analyze data. My projects cover a range of machine learning technqiues, including:
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Classification
- Unsupervised LEarning: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing (1-sample tests, 2-sample tests)

Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of each project.
