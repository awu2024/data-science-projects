# Data Science Projects Portfolio
## Description
Welcome to my repository showcasing various data science projects! These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling using Python.

Throughout these projects, I utilize libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to explore, process, and analyze data. My projects cover a range of machine learning technqiues, including:
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Classification
- Unsupervised LEarning: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing (1-sample tests, 2-sample tests)

Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of each project.

## Analyzing Senator Votes and Predicing Political Alignment Using Cosine Similarity

In this project, I developed a machine learning model that determines a senator's voting record that is the closest match to another senator's voting record using cosine similarity. 

This project demonstrates my work in the following areas:
- Cleaning and structuring voting records
- Implementing cosine similarity to measure closest voting records between senators
- Extracting XML files from websites, converting them to .csv format, and loading them into Python as a Pandas Dataframe
